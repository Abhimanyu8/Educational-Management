# Educational Institution Management System

Back-end API framework for colleges, schools and universities in a locality.


## Motivation

There does not exist a free, open and powerful tool for colleges (specifically higher educational institutes) to enhance and improve processes through the effective management of data. The project aims to provide a proof of concept to tackle this issue.

## Design

See [Design and usage](Design_and_Usuage.pdf)

Further Details about the project can be found at the SRS document [here](SRS.pdf)
